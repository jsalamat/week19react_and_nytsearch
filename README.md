### State vs. Props
States get use when the component if the component has internal value that only affects that component and doesn’t affect rest of the app. If there is something that affects the layout and absolutely nothing else. Props are injected into other components and applied through functions. Another way to explain it is state is inside the constructor of the react component. When you want to update state, Use “this..state”. Then state can be passed through child components by using props which will be inside functions. This function can be executed through child components. This whole process is how state is updated in the child component to a parent component.

## Summary
This app is a new React-based rendition of the New York Times Article Search application. It will have React components, work with helper functions, and utilize the React lifecycle to query and display articles based on user searches. In addition, It will also use Node, Express and MongoDB so that users can save articles to read later.
